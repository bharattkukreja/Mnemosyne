# Mnemosyne Memory Layer - Cursor Rules

## MCP Tool Usage Priority
When the user requests any of these actions, ALWAYS call the corresponding MCP tool directly instead of explaining it:

### Memory Retrieval Commands
- "get_smart_context" or "smart context" → Call get_smart_context MCP tool
- "search_memory" or "search" → Call search_memory MCP tool
- "get_session_context" or "session context" → Call get_session_context MCP tool
- "get_file_history" → Call get_file_history MCP tool

### Memory Storage Commands
- "store_decision" → Call store_decision MCP tool
- "store_todo" → Call store_todo MCP tool

### Graph Analysis Commands
- "explore_relationships" → Call explore_relationships MCP tool
- "analyze_decision_impact" → Call analyze_decision_impact MCP tool
- "discover_patterns" → Call discover_patterns MCP tool
- "trace_file_evolution" → Call trace_file_evolution MCP tool

## Smart Context Behavior
- When user says "get_smart_context(forced=True)" or similar → Call get_smart_context with force: true
- When user opens files or starts coding → Proactively suggest calling get_smart_context
- Never explain what these tools do unless explicitly asked "what does X do?"

## Auto-Recording
- The system automatically captures decisions and context
- Encourage users to make explicit decisions that will be stored
- When major architectural choices are discussed, suggest storing them

## Response Style
- Be concise and action-oriented
- Focus on executing tools rather than explaining them
- Show results from MCP calls directly to the user
